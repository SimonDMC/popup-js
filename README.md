## Usage/Examples

Create a popup by instantiating the Popup class with customization parameters.

```javascript

    id: "my-popup",
    title: "My First Popup",
    content: `
        An example popup.
        Supports multiple lines.`,
});
```

Display the popup by calling the `.show()` method.

```javascript
myPopup.show();
```
